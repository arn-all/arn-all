I am a post-doc at CEA Saclay, where I develop new machine learning / deep learning methods to analyse processes that happend at the atomic scale ðŸ”¬ in metals: phase transformations, defects formation and evolution in environment,... using novel atomic descriptors and force-fields.

I also intensively use computational methods such as molecular dynamics to study solid state physics problems at different scales, such as [simulations of plasticity in metals](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013608), which is mediated by dislocation motion -actually the subject of [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03728547).
